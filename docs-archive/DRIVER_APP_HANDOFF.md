# Driver App Integration - Handoff Status

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 In Progress - BLOCKED by schema validation  
**Next:** Delete persistent audit log entry, then continue Phase 1 testing

---

## 🚧 **Current Blocker**

**Error:** One old audit log entry missing required fields:
```
Document ID: j575bq3hwgqpghhw7atfpy9s3d7t2929
Table: auditLogs
Issue: Missing complianceFlags.exportRestricted and retentionPeriodYears
```

**Resolution:** Transferred to Driver App team (separate Cursor instance) to delete via Convex Dashboard.

---

## 📋 **What's Been Handed Off**

### **Comprehensive Handoff Document:**
**Location:** `/Users/soderstrom/generated_repos/spec-kit-expo-router/cab-driver-mobile-dash/HANDOFF_FROM_DISPATCH_TEAM.md`

**Contains:**
- Immediate fix instructions (delete via dashboard)
- Complete schema reference
- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Files already modified
- Common issues and solutions
- Coordination strategy between apps

### **Files Modified in Driver App:**
1. ✅ `.env.local` - Convex URL configured
2. ✅ `convex/_generated/` - Types copied from unified schema
3. ✅ `app/(tabs)/dashboard/index.tsx` - Fixed query to `drivers:listAll`
4. ✅ `app/(tabs)/routes/index.tsx` - Added connection test banner
5. ✅ `app/(tabs)/profile/index.tsx` - Fixed query, removed badges

### **Ready for Driver App Team:**
- Connection test code in place
- Types synchronized
- Environment configured
- Just needs audit log deletion to proceed

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps (Driver App Team)**

### **Phase 1 Completion:**
1. Delete audit log via dashboard
2. Verify app loads without errors
3. Confirm green connection banner appears
4. Report back status

### **Phase 2: Real Routes:**
- Create `hooks/useDriverRoutes.ts`
- Query routes for logged-in driver
- Replace mock data in routes screen

### **Phase 3: Three-Button System:**
- Picked Up ✅
- No-Go ❌
- Pre-Cancel 🔔

### **Phase 4: Bidirectional Sync Test:**
- Dispatch creates route → Driver sees it
- Driver updates status → Dispatch reflects change

## 📞 **Coordination**

**Two Cursor Instances:**
- **Instance #1 (This):** Dispatch App at `/Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo/`
- **Instance #2 (New):** Driver App at `/Users/soderstrom/generated_repos/spec-kit-expo-router/cab-driver-mobile-dash/`

**Shared Resources:**
- Convex deployment: `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
- Convex functions: Root `convex/` directory in this workspace
- Database: Unified schema (drivers, children, routes, auditLogs)

**Communication:**
- Updates will be shared via STATUS.md in both repos
- Critical changes coordinated before Convex schema modifications
- Types re-copied after schema changes

---

## ✅ **Dispatch App Status**

**WORKING SUCCESSFULLY:**
- ✅ Calendar navigation
- ✅ Copy Previous Day's Schedule (tested with 25 routes)
- ✅ Real-time Convex sync
- ✅ All schema errors resolved
- ✅ Audit logging working correctly

**Ready for integration testing once Driver App Phase 1 completes.**

## 🔄 **When Schema Changes**

If Convex schema is modified in the future:

```bash
# 1. Update schema in root
cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo/convex
# ... edit schema.ts ...

# 2. Restart Convex dev (if not auto-reloading)
# Press Ctrl+C, then:
npx convex dev

# 3. Update Dispatch App types
cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo/dispatch-app/convex
rm -rf _generated
cp -r ../../convex/_generated .

# 4. Update Driver App types
cd /Users/soderstrom/generated_repos/spec-kit-expo-router/cab-driver-mobile-dash/convex
rm -rf _generated
cp -r /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo/convex/_generated .

# 5. Restart both Expo apps (press 'r')
```

**CRITICAL:** Always update both apps' `_generated` directories after schema changes!
