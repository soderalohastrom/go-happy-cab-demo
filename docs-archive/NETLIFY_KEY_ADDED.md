## 🔐 Security Notes

**About This Key:**
- This is a **development** deploy key (not production)
- It's read-only - can only fetch schema/generate types
- Cannot modify data or deployment settings
- Safe to use in Netlify CI/CD environment

**Why Development Key?**
Your POC app currently connects to the **dev deployment**:
- `.env.local`: `VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
- This is the dev deployment, not production
- Therefore we need the dev deploy key

**Future Consideration:**
When you're ready for true production:
1. Create a **production deployment** in Convex
2. Generate a **production deploy key**
3. Update Netlify to use production key
4. Update `VITE_CONVEX_URL` to production URL

---

## ⚠️ Important: Don't Commit the Key

**Never commit this key to your repository!**
- ✅ Store it in Netlify environment variables (done)
- ✅ Mark as "Secret" in Netlify (recommended)
- ❌ Don't add to `.env.local` and commit
- ❌ Don't hardcode in source files

---

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After adding the key and deploying:

- [ ] Netlify build completes without errors
- [ ] Build log shows "Generating TypeScript bindings..."
- [ ] Build log shows "✓ built in XXXms"
- [ ] Deployed site loads at your Netlify URL
- [ ] POC app connects to Convex (check browser console)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality works
- [ ] Real-time data syncs

---

## 📞 If Build Still Fails

1. **Verify the key is exactly:**
   ```
   dev:colorful-wildcat-524|eyJ2MiI6IjM3YTE1MTUxYTRhNzRmZTJhODE3MmI0YTJmOTNkOWNlIn0=
   ```
   (No extra spaces or line breaks!)

2. **Check it's named exactly:**
   ```
   CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY
   ```
   (Case-sensitive!)

3. **Verify it's in "All scopes" or "Builds" scope**

4. **Try manually triggering a deploy** (don't rely on auto-deploy)

---

## 🎉 Success Indicator

When it works, your Netlify site will:
- ✅ Show "Published" status
- ✅ Load the POC app
- ✅ Connect to Convex in real-time
- ✅ Display children and drivers from your database

---

**Next:** Add the key to Netlify and trigger a rebuild! 🚀
