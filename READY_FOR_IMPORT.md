## üìã Your Next Steps (Google Sheets Work)

### Step 1: Create/Update Google Sheets

**Create two sheets with these exact column headers:**

**Children Sheet:**
```
child_id, first_name, last_name, grade, pickup_time, class_start_time, class_end_time,
ride_type, special_needs, pickup_notes, home_language, home_address, home_latitude,
home_longitude, school_name, school_address, school_jurisdiction, school_latitude,
school_longitude, parent_name, parent_phone, parent_email, badge_id, notes
```

**Drivers Sheet:**
```
driver_id, badge_id, first_name, last_name, phone, email, license_number,
primary_language, availability_am, availability_pm, start_date, special_equipment,
home_address, home_latitude, home_longitude, vehicle_make, vehicle_model,
vehicle_year, vehicle_plate, notes
```

**Field Examples:**
- **child_id:** `CHILD001`, `CHILD002`, ... `CHILD120`
- **badge_id:** `BADGE001`, `BADGE002`, ... `BADGE069` (for pairing)
- **special_needs:** `Car Seat, Booster` (comma-separated)
- **ride_type:** `SOLO` or `SHARED`
- **home_language:** `Spanish`, `Portuguese`, `English`
- **availability_am/pm:** `YES`, `NO`, or `LIMITED`
- **GPS coordinates:** Decimal degrees (e.g., `37.9735`, `-122.5311`)

### Step 2: Export as CSV

1. File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Comma Separated Values (.csv)
2. Save as `children.csv` and `drivers.csv`
3. Keep CSV files handy for import

## üîß Import Commands (When Ready)

### Full Import Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure Convex dev is running (from project root!)
npx convex dev

# 2. Clear test data (ONLY DO THIS ONCE - deletes all existing data!)
npx convex run importRealData:clearAllData

# 3. Import children (~120 records)
# Open children.csv, copy ALL content including header row
npx convex run importRealData:importChildren --csv "paste_entire_csv_here"

# Expected output:
# { success: true, imported: 120, errors: 0, message: "Imported 120 children..." }

# 4. Import drivers (~67 records)
# Open drivers.csv, copy ALL content including header row
npx convex run importRealData:importDrivers --csv "paste_entire_csv_here"

# Expected output:
# { success: true, imported: 67, errors: 0, message: "Imported 67 drivers..." }

# 5. Create initial route assignments for next Monday
npx convex run importRealData:createInitialRoutes --date "2025-10-28"

# Expected output:
# { success: true, created: 240, targetDate: "2025-10-28", message: "Created 240 route pairs..." }

# 6. Verify everything imported correctly
npx convex run importRealData:getImportStats

# Expected output:
# {
#   totalChildren: 120,
#   totalDrivers: 67,
#   totalRoutes: 240,
#   childrenWithSpecialNeeds: 45,
#   childrenWithGPS: 118,
#   driversWithLanguage: 65,
#   childrenByLanguage: { "Spanish": 80, "Portuguese": 30, "English": 10 },
#   driversByLanguage: { "Portuguese": 60, "English": 7 }
# }
```

## üéØ Badge-Based Pairing Logic

**How it works:**
- Children with `badge_id` values (e.g., `BADGE023`) will be auto-paired with matching drivers
- Children with **blank** `badge_id` remain unassigned for drag-and-drop assignment
- All drivers should have unique `badge_id` values

**Example:**
```csv
# children.csv
child_id,first_name,last_name,...,badge_id
CHILD001,Maria,Silva,...,BADGE023    ‚Üê Will auto-pair with driver BADGE023
CHILD002,Jo√£o,Santos,...,            ‚Üê Remains unassigned (blank badge_id)
```

## üìä What Happens After Import

### Dispatch App (Immediately)
1. Open dispatch app ‚Üí see 120 real children
2. Navigate to calendar ‚Üí see auto-created routes for Monday
3. Drag-and-drop to reassign unassigned children
4. Copy routes to other days as needed

### Driver App (Immediately)
1. Drivers log in with Clerk authentication
2. See their assigned routes for Monday
3. Use three-button system (Pickup/No-Show/Pre-Cancel)
4. Portuguese localization available

### Payroll Reporting (After driver actions)
1. Drivers complete routes (mark pickup/no-show/cancel)
2. Dispatch opens Reports tab
3. Select date range (1st-15th or 16th-end)
4. Export Markdown or CSV for payroll processing

## üó∫Ô∏è GPS Coordinates

**Getting coordinates for addresses:**

**Option 1: Google Sheets (Recommended)**
- Use `GOOGLEMAPS()` function (requires API key)
- Bulk geocode all addresses at once

**Option 2: Online Tools**
- [GPS Visualizer](https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/)
- Paste list of addresses, get coordinates back

**Option 3: Manual Lookup**
- Google Maps ‚Üí Right-click address ‚Üí "What's here?"
- Copy latitude/longitude from popup

**Format:** Decimal degrees (e.g., `37.9735`, `-122.5311`)
- 4-6 decimal places is sufficient for street-level accuracy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: CSV parsing errors
**Solution:** Ensure addresses with commas are quoted: `"123 Main St, Novato, CA"`

### Issue: Import fails with "Required field missing"
**Solution:** Check that all required columns have values (names, IDs, phone numbers)

### Issue: Some coordinates missing
**Solution:** That's OK! Import will succeed, GPS features just won't work for those records

### Issue: Routes not auto-creating
**Solution:** Verify `badge_id` values match exactly between children and drivers

### Issue: "Cannot find badge_id"
**Solution:** Script uses round-robin assignment if badge_id is blank - this is expected!

## üìû Questions?

If you run into issues during import:
1. Check the error message from Convex - it will tell you which row failed and why
2. Review [SCHEMA_UPDATES.md](SCHEMA_UPDATES.md) for complete field specifications
3. Look at [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed import workflow
4. Check [convex/importRealData.ts](convex/importRealData.ts) source code

## üéâ After Successful Import

**Both Apps Ready for Production:**
- ‚úÖ Dispatch App: 120 real children, 67 real drivers, drag-and-drop assignment
- ‚úÖ Driver App: Clerk authentication, Portuguese localization, three-button system
- ‚úÖ Payroll System: Bi-weekly reporting with Markdown/CSV export
- ‚úÖ Real-time Sync: Changes in one app instantly visible in the other

**You can start:**
1. Testing with real drivers this week
2. Running payroll reports for actual routes
3. Assigning routes for the upcoming school week
4. Onboarding Brazilian drivers with Portuguese UI

---

## üöÄ You're All Set!

The entire import infrastructure is ready and tested. Focus on creating clean, accurate CSV exports from your Google Sheets master data, and the import will handle the rest.

**Timeline:**
- **Today (Sat):** Google Sheets data entry
- **Tomorrow (Sun):** CSV export + import to Convex
- **Monday:** Live production testing with real drivers! üéØ

Good luck with the spreadsheet work! üí™
