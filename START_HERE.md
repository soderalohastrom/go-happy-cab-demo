# üöÄ START HERE - Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST IMPORTANT RULE

**ALWAYS run `npx convex dev` from THIS directory:**
```bash
/Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo
```

**NEVER from dispatch-app or driver-app!**

## üìã Daily Development Workflow

### Step 1: Start Convex Backend (Terminal 1)

```bash
# Navigate to main project root
cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo

# Start Convex (leave this running!)
npx convex dev
```

You should see:
```
‚úî 12:36:42 Convex functions ready! (1.74s)
```

### Step 2: Start Dispatch App (Terminal 2)

# Navigate to dispatch-app
cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo/dispatch-app

# Start Expo
npx expo start

# Press 'i' for iOS simulator or scan QR code for device
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Start Driver App (Terminal 3)

```bash
# Navigate to driver-app

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Could not find public function" errors

**Problem:** Convex dev is running from wrong directory

**Solution:**
1. Check where Convex is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep "convex dev" | grep -v grep
   ```

2. If it shows `dispatch-app` in the path, kill it:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "convex dev"
   ```

3. Restart from correct location:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo
   npx convex dev
   ```

### App won't load or shows stale data

**Solution:** Reload the Expo app by pressing **'r'** in the terminal

### Schema changes not appearing

**Solution:** Copy updated types to both apps:
```bash
cd /Users/soderstrom/2025/October/go-happy-cab-demo

# Copy to dispatch-app
cp -r convex/_generated dispatch-app/convex/

# Copy to driver-app
cp -r convex/_generated /Users/soderstrom/generated_repos/spec-kit-expo-router/cab-driver-mobile-dash/convex/
```

Then reload both Expo apps (press 'r')
