# Netlify Deployment Fixed ✅

**Status:** Build configuration updated and pushed to GitHub
**Commit:** `5a4cf33` - fix(netlify): add convex codegen to build process
**Date:** October 26, 2025

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Netlify builds were failing with:
```
Could not resolve "../convex/_generated/api" from "src/App.jsx"
```

**Root Cause:** Convex generated files (`convex/_generated/api`) were not being created during the Netlify build process. The POC App imports these types, but they didn't exist at build time.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Build Script** (`package.json`)

**Before:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx convex codegen && vite build"
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Runs `npx convex codegen` FIRST to generate Convex types
- Then runs `vite build` to bundle the app
- Ensures `convex/_generated/api` exists when Vite processes imports

---

### 2. **Created Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

  [build.environment]
    VITE_CONVEX_URL = "https://colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**What this does:**
- Sets the Convex deployment URL for production builds
- Configures SPA redirects (all routes → index.html)
- Adds security headers

---

## ✅ Build Verification

**Tested locally:**
```bash
npm run build

# Output:
# > npx convex codegen && vite build
# Finding component definitions...
# Generating TypeScript bindings...
# ✓ 131 modules transformed.
# ✓ built in 810ms
```

**Success!** ✅ The build completes without errors.

---

## 🚀 Netlify Deployment

**Status:** Changes pushed to GitHub → Netlify will auto-deploy

**GitHub push:**
```bash
git push origin master
# To https://github.com/soderalohastrom/go-happy-cab-demo.git
#    6f9df0a..5a4cf33  master -> master
```

**Netlify will:**
1. Detect the new commit on `master` branch
2. Run `npm run build` (which now includes codegen)
3. Generate `convex/_generated/api` types
4. Build successfully with Vite
5. Deploy to your Netlify URL

---

## 📊 Expected Netlify Build Log

You should see this in your next Netlify build:

```
$ npm run build
> npx convex codegen && vite build

Finding component definitions...

## 🔍 What to Check

### 1. **Netlify Dashboard**
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
- Find your "go-happy-cab-demo" site
- Check the latest deploy (should be from commit `5a4cf33`)
- Status should be: ✅ **Published**

### 2. **Live Site**
- Your Netlify URL should now load the POC app
- Test the calendar and drag-and-drop features
- Verify Convex connection (should see real-time data)

---

## 🎯 Files Changed

### Modified:
- **package.json** - Updated build script to include codegen
- **netlify.toml** - NEW - Netlify configuration

### Committed:
```
commit 5a4cf33
fix(netlify): add convex codegen to build process

- Updated build script: npx convex codegen && vite build
- Created netlify.toml with environment vars and redirects
- Tested locally, build works correctly
```

---

## 🆘 If Build Still Fails

### Check Netlify Environment Variables
Go to: Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL` = `https://colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`

(Should be set automatically from netlify.toml, but verify)

### Check Build Command
Go to: Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Build Settings

**Should be:**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

### Manual Deploy (If needed)
If you have Netlify CLI installed:

```bash
# From project root
netlify deploy --prod

# Or test build first
netlify deploy --build
```

---

## 📝 Notes

**Why This Works:**
1. Netlify runs `npm run build`
2. Our build script now runs codegen BEFORE Vite
3. `convex/_generated/api` is created in the build environment
4. Vite can resolve the import from `src/App.jsx`
5. Build succeeds, app deploys ✅

**Convex Connection:**
- The deployed app connects to the production Convex deployment
- URL: `https://colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
- Same deployment used by local dev and dispatch/driver apps
- Real-time sync works across all apps

**POC vs Dispatch App:**
- This deployment is for the **POC App** (Vite, web-only)
- Located in project root (not dispatch-app/)
- Original demo with `@dnd-kit` drag-and-drop
- Preserved as reference/demo while Dispatch App is the mobile version

---

## ✅ Summary

**Fixed:** Netlify build failures due to missing Convex generated files
**Solution:** Added `npx convex codegen` to build script
**Status:** Pushed to GitHub, Netlify will auto-deploy
**Next:** Check Netlify dashboard for successful deployment

The POC app should now deploy successfully to Netlify! 🎉
