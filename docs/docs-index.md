## Documentation Philosophy

**CLAUDE.md** - How to develop (architecture, patterns, commands)
**STATUS.md** - What's done and what's next (feature tracking)
**docs/** - Active feature specs and analysis
**docs-archive/** - Historical milestones and one-time setup guides

**When to Archive:**
- Phase completion documents after phase is merged
- Migration/planning docs after implementation is complete
- One-time setup guides after initial configuration
- Handoff documents after collaboration is complete

**When to Keep Active:**
- Current feature specifications
- Ongoing data analysis documents
- In-progress implementation references
