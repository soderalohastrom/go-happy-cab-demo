# Go Happy Cab Demo - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional  
**Convex Deployment:** gohappymatching (dev)

## Current State

The real-time scheduling system for child transportation management is fully operational with calendar-based assignment tracking, drag-and-drop interface, and copy-from-previous-day functionality.

### Working Features
- ✅ **Date navigation** - Calendar view with prev/next controls
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop assignments** - Bidirectional (child→driver, driver→child)
- ✅ **AM/PM period switching** - Separate route management
- ✅ **Copy Previous Day's Routes** - One-click bulk copy (24 assignments)
- ✅ **Real-time sync** - WebSocket updates across multiple tabs
- ✅ **Audit logging** - All mutations tracked in database
- ✅ **Conflict prevention** - No double-booking allowed

### Recent Fix (Oct 24, 2025)
**Issue:** `copyFromPreviousDay` mutation was failing with schema validation error  
**Root Cause:** `auditLog` table schema was missing `count` and `fromDate` fields in the `details` object  
**Solution:** Updated `convex/schema.ts` to add:
- `count: v.optional(v.string())` - For bulk operation tracking
- `fromDate: v.optional(v.string())` - For copy operation source tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `convex/schema.ts` - Lines 59-60 (added missing fields)

**Testing:** Verified by clicking "Copy Previous Day's Routes" button on October 26, 2025:
- ✅ Successfully copied 24 assignments (12 AM + 12 PM)
- ✅ No schema validation errors
- ✅ Audit log entry created correctly

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 + Vite
- @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- react-calendar for date navigation
- TailwindCSS for styling

### Backend
- Convex real-time database
- WebSocket-based sync
- Automatic schema validation
- Built-in audit logging

## Data Model

### Entities
- **Children** - 18 active (master list)
- **Drivers** - 12 active (master list)
- **Assignments** - Date + period + child + driver pairings
- **AuditLog** - Complete change history

### Seed Data (85% Pre-Paired)
- Oct 24: 13 AM routes, 12 PM routes (25 total)
- Oct 25: 12 AM routes, 12 PM routes (24 total)
- Typically 2-3 unassigned children/drivers per period
- Reflects real-world scenario where most routes are consistent

## Commands

```bash
# Development (requires 2 terminals)
npx convex dev        # Terminal 1: Backend sync
npm run dev           # Terminal 2: Frontend dev server

# Database operations
npx convex run seed:seedData    # Seed initial data
npx convex dashboard            # Open dashboard
npx convex logs --history 50    # View recent logs

# Build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Known Constraints

1. **No Authentication** - Public access only (auth planned)
2. **No Offline Support** - Requires internet connection
3. **Single Assignment Creation** - No bulk manual entry
4. **No Export** - CSV/PDF reports not implemented
5. **Web Only** - Mobile app version not built

## Next Steps

### Migration to React Native Expo Router
**See `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` for complete plan**

The POC has proven the concept successfully. Next phase: Convert to mobile-first React Native Expo Router app for:
- ✅ Touch-optimized drag-and-drop for dispatcher
- ✅ Native iOS/Android apps + Web platform
- ✅ Shared Convex backend with driver mobile app
- ✅ Real-time sync and push notifications

**Migration Approach:** Create `dispatch-app/` subdirectory, preserve POC as reference

### Future POC Enhancements (if staying web-only)
- [ ] Consider adding user authentication
- [ ] Implement bulk assignment creation UI
- [ ] Add CSV export for reporting
- [ ] Add calendar month/year navigation
- [ ] Consider undo/redo for accidental deletions

## Environment

**Dev URL:** http://localhost:5173  
**Convex Dashboard:** https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/rugged-mule-519  
**Deployment:** gohappymatching (dev)

Environment variables configured in `.env.local`:
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` - Dev deployment name
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL` - Client connection URL

## Important Files

- `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema definitions
- `convex/assignments.ts` - Assignment CRUD + copy logic
- `convex/seed.ts` - Initial data population
- `src/App.jsx` - Main UI component
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines and architecture
- `SETUP.md` - Setup instructions and testing guide

---

**Development Notes:**
- Convex dev process must be running for schema changes
- Schema validation is strict - all fields must match exactly
- Audit log captures all mutations with full context
- Real-time updates happen automatically via WebSocket
