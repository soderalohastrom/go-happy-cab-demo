# Go Happy Cab - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ðŸš€ Migration to Unified Architecture  
**Unified Convex:** `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`

## Current State

**Three Apps, One Database:** Integrating dispatch and driver apps with unified Convex backend for real-time synchronization.

### App Status
1. **âœ… POC App (Vite)** - Original demo, fully functional, preserved at root
2. **âœ… Dispatch App (Expo)** - Mobile-first dispatch app, core features working
3. **ðŸš§ Driver App (Expo)** - Retrofitting to use unified Convex deployment

### Dispatch App - Working Features
- âœ… **Monthly calendar** - react-native-calendars with route indicators
- âœ… **Date navigation** - Prev/today/next buttons with date picker
- âœ… **AM/PM period tabs** - Separate route management
- âœ… **Copy Previous Day's Schedule** - Bulk copy (25 routes tested)
- âœ… **Real-time Convex sync** - WebSocket updates
- âœ… **Route assignment UI** - Child/driver lists with remove functionality
- âœ… **Unified schema integration** - All 4 schema errors resolved

### Recent Accomplishments (Oct 24, 2025)

**Dispatch App Migration Complete:**
- âœ… Created dispatch-app/ subdirectory with Expo Router
- âœ… Built unified Convex schema (650+ lines) merging dispatch + driver needs
- âœ… Created new Convex deployment: `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
- âœ… Implemented MonthCalendar, DateNavigator, AssignmentScreen components
- âœ… Fixed 4 schema validation errors systematically:
  1. Index naming (`by_date` â†’ `by_date_period`)
  2. Timestamp format (`Date.now()` â†’ `new Date().toISOString()`)
  3. Missing `type` field (added `"pickup"` | `"dropoff"`)
  4. Missing `updatedAt` field (added ISO string)
- âœ… Tested "Copy Previous Day's Schedule" - **25 routes copied successfully**

**Next: Driver App Integration**
- ðŸš§ Update to unified Convex deployment
- ðŸš§ Retrofit core features: Today's routes + 3-button system
- ðŸš§ Remove unnecessary features (badges, etc.)
- ðŸš§ Test bidirectional real-time sync

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 + Vite
- @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- react-calendar for date navigation
- TailwindCSS for styling

### Backend
- Convex real-time database
- WebSocket-based sync
- Automatic schema validation
- Built-in audit logging

## Data Model

### Entities
- **Children** - 18 active (master list)
- **Drivers** - 12 active (master list)
- **Assignments** - Date + period + child + driver pairings
- **AuditLog** - Complete change history

### Seed Data (85% Pre-Paired)
- Oct 24: 13 AM routes, 12 PM routes (25 total)
- Oct 25: 12 AM routes, 12 PM routes (24 total)
- Typically 2-3 unassigned children/drivers per period
- Reflects real-world scenario where most routes are consistent

## Commands

```bash
# Development (requires 2 terminals)
npx convex dev        # Terminal 1: Backend sync
npm run dev           # Terminal 2: Frontend dev server

# Database operations
npx convex run seed:seedData    # Seed initial data
npx convex dashboard            # Open dashboard
npx convex logs --history 50    # View recent logs

# Build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Known Constraints

1. **No Authentication** - Public access only (auth planned)
2. **No Offline Support** - Requires internet connection
3. **Single Assignment Creation** - No bulk manual entry
4. **No Export** - CSV/PDF reports not implemented
5. **Web Only** - Mobile app version not built

## Next Steps

### Migration to React Native Expo Router
**See `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` for complete plan**

The POC has proven the concept successfully. Next phase: Convert to mobile-first React Native Expo Router app for:
- âœ… Touch-optimized drag-and-drop for dispatcher
- âœ… Native iOS/Android apps + Web platform
- âœ… Shared Convex backend with driver mobile app
- âœ… Real-time sync and push notifications

**Migration Approach:** Create `dispatch-app/` subdirectory, preserve POC as reference

### Future POC Enhancements (if staying web-only)
- [ ] Consider adding user authentication
- [ ] Implement bulk assignment creation UI
- [ ] Add CSV export for reporting
- [ ] Add calendar month/year navigation
- [ ] Consider undo/redo for accidental deletions

## Environment

### POC App (Vite)
**Dev URL:** http://localhost:5173  
**Old Convex:** `rugged-mule-519.convex.cloud` (preserved for POC demo)

### Dispatch App (Expo)
**Expo Dev:** `npx expo start` in `dispatch-app/`  
**Unified Convex:** `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`

### Driver App (Expo)  
**Location:** `/Users/soderstrom/generated_repos/spec-kit-expo-router/cab-driver-mobile-dash/`  
**Status:** Being retrofitted to use unified Convex

### Convex Dashboard
**Unified Deployment:** https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings/colorful-wildcat-524  
**Deployment Name:** `colorful-wildcat-524`

Environment variables:
- **POC:** `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local`
- **Dispatch:** `EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in `dispatch-app/.env.local`  
- **Driver:** `EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (to be created)

**Development Notes:**
- Convex dev process must be running for schema changes
- Schema validation is strict - all fields must match exactly
- Audit log captures all mutations with full context
- Real-time updates happen automatically via WebSocket
