# Go Happy Cab - Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025
**Status:** 🎉 GOOGLE SHEETS PAYROLL EXPORT COMPLETE!
**Unified Convex:** `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
**Branch:** `master`

## 🎉 **LATEST: GOOGLE SHEETS PAYROLL EXPORT - PRODUCTION READY!**

**Nov 21, 2025** - **One-click payroll export to Google Sheets with professional formatting - FULLY WORKING!**

### ✅ Phase 8: Google Sheets Integration - COMPLETE & TESTED

**📊 Google Sheets Export:**
- ✅ **One-Click Export** - "Google Sheets" button in PayrollReport component
- ✅ **Professional Formatting** - Bold headers, currency formatting, totals row highlighted
- ✅ **Two-Tab Spreadsheet** - Summary (driver data) + Configuration (pay rates, date range)
- ✅ **Service Account Integration** - Backend-only authentication, no user login required
- ✅ **Google Shared Drive Storage** - All exports saved to "Go Happy Cab Payroll" Shared Drive (unlimited storage)
- ✅ **Auto-Open Browser** - Spreadsheet opens automatically after export
- ✅ **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages for service account issues
- ✅ **Loading States** - ActivityIndicator during export process
- ✅ **Success Confirmation** - Alert with driver count and total payroll summary
- ⏸️ **Audit Logging** - Temporarily disabled (non-critical, re-enable later)

**🔐 Service Account Configuration:**
- ✅ **Google Cloud Project** - Created `go-happy-sheets` with service account
- ✅ **Service Account Created** - dispatch-payroll-exporter@go-happy-sheets.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- ✅ **Google Shared Drive Solution** - Created "Go Happy Cab Payroll" Shared Drive (ID: `0AIFH-AbD3bQ2Uk9PVA`)
- ✅ **Service Account Permissions** - Added as Manager to Shared Drive
- ✅ **Environment Variables Set** - GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL, GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY, GOOGLE_PAYROLL_FOLDER_ID
- ✅ **Shared Drive API Support** - Added `supportsAllDrives: true` to Drive API calls

**🛠️ Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ **Backend:** `convex/googleSheets.ts` - Node.js action using googleapis with service account JWT auth
- ✅ **Frontend Hook:** `dispatch-app/hooks/useGoogleSheetsExport.ts` - No Clerk dependencies
- ✅ **Direct Action Call:** PayrollReport uses `useAction` (not `useMutation`) for external API
- ✅ **UI Enhancement:** Side-by-side CSV + Google Sheets export buttons
- ✅ **No Clerk in Dispatch App** - Removed ClerkProvider (walled garden distribution via ABM/Managed Google Play)
- ✅ **Shared Drive API:** `supportsAllDrives: true` parameter required for Team Drive access

**🎉 Success Notes:**
- **Tested:** Export working perfectly with real payroll data
- **Storage Solution:** Google Shared Drives bypass service account 0-byte quota limitation
- **Professional Output:** Bold headers, currency formatting, auto-resize columns, totals row highlighting
- **Team Access:** Organization-owned Shared Drive allows team collaboration without individual authentication

**📋 Completed User Actions:**
1. ✅ **Test Export:** Successfully exported payroll to Google Sheets
2. ✅ **Verify Folder:** Spreadsheet confirmed in "Go Happy Cab Payroll" Shared Drive
3. ✅ **Test Formatting:** Professional formatting confirmed (headers, currency, colors)
4. ✅ **Test Browser Open:** Auto-open URL confirmed working

**🎯 Benefits:**
- Eliminates manual CSV import to spreadsheets
- Professional formatting ready for accounting team
- Centralized Shared Drive storage for unlimited team access
- No per-user authentication (perfect for walled garden distribution)
- Zapier/n8n automation potential (trigger on new spreadsheet)
- Organization-owned storage (not tied to individual accounts)

- ✅ **Visual Stacking** - Green driver card shows stacked children (up to 3 max) with counter badge
- ✅ **One-Directional Drag** - Only children can be dragged onto drivers (prevents accidental driver drags)
- ✅ **Expandable Route Groups** - Paired routes display as carpool groups (🚗👧👧) with tap-to-expand
- ✅ **Individual Route Records** - Each child gets separate route record (same driverId/date/period)
- ✅ **Backend Max Validation** - Convex enforces max 3 children per carpool with clear error messages
- ✅ **Testing Helper** - "Clear All Routes" button (🗑️) for rapid testing cycles
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Contextual alerts guide users (e.g., "Already assigned" with testing workarounds)

**🎉 Oct 25, 2025 - PHASE 2 COMPLETE: DRIVER MANAGEMENT**
- ✅ **Linked Clerk & Convex:** Added `clerkId` to the `drivers` schema, creating a secure link between authentication and database records.
- ✅ **Driver Management UI:** Built a new "Drivers" tab in the Dispatch App to list all drivers with their active/inactive status.
- ✅ **Add Driver Workflow:** Implemented the full end-to-end "Add Driver" flow. The dispatch app now calls a Convex action that securely creates a user in Clerk and a corresponding driver record in Convex.
- ✅ **Deactivate/Reactivate:** Implemented soft-delete functionality, allowing dispatchers to manage the active driver roster without losing historical data.
- ✅ **Fixed All Bugs:** Systematically resolved 4 bugs during implementation (import errors, Clerk password requirements, API reference errors, and data validation).

**🎯 Oct 25, 2025 - UI & UX Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ **Fixed inactive tab counts** - AM/PM tabs now show correct counts even when not selected.
- ✅ **Fixed drag-and-drop offset** - Dragged card is now perfectly centered on the user's finger by resolving a coordinate space mismatch.
- ✅ **Fixed duplicate assignment bug** - Added robust server-side validation with new database indexes to prevent race conditions when pairing/un-pairing quickly.

**🎉 Oct 25, 2025 - MOBILE DRAG-AND-DROP IMPLEMENTED!**
- ✅ Installed react-native-gesture-handler + react-native-reanimated
- ✅ Created DraggableCard component with pan gestures and scale animations
- ✅ Created DropZone component with collision detection
- ✅ Ported drag-end logic from POC (child↔driver pairing)
- ✅ Implemented side-by-side column layout (children | drivers)
- ✅ Added visual feedback (scale 1.1x, shadows during drag)
- ✅ Wrapped app with GestureHandlerRootView
- ✅ Updated tab names (Dispatch | Reports)
- ✅ **Result:** Dispatcher can drag children onto drivers to create routes!

**🎯 Oct 25, 2025 - UX REFINEMENTS (Dispatcher Feedback):**
- ✅ **Reordered layout** - Unassigned at top (15% need attention), paired routes at bottom (85% static)
- ✅ **Fixed z-index** - Dragged cards now float on top of all elements (zIndex: 9999, elevation: 10)
- ✅ **Sort toggle** - Alphabetical by child or driver for quick searching (find sick driver, locate child)

**Oct 24, 2025 - Dispatch App Migration Complete:**
- ✅ Created dispatch-app/ subdirectory with Expo Router
- ✅ Built unified Convex schema (650+ lines) merging dispatch + driver needs
- ✅ Created new Convex deployment: `colorful-wildcat-524.convex.cloud`
- ✅ Implemented MonthCalendar, DateNavigator, AssignmentScreen components
- ✅ Fixed 4 schema validation errors systematically:
  1. Index naming (`by_date` → `by_date_period`)
  2. Timestamp format (`Date.now()` → `new Date().toISOString()`)
  3. Missing `type` field (added `"pickup"` | `"dropoff"`)
  4. Missing `updatedAt` field (added ISO string)
- ✅ Tested "Copy Previous Day's Schedule" - **25 routes copied successfully**

  - `driverActions:updateNoShowStatus` - Report child absent
  - `driverActions:updatePreCancelStatus` - Acknowledge pre-cancel
- ✅ **Dispatch events system** - Real-time sync operational
- ✅ **Dispatch App UI** - Status badges show driver updates live
- ✅ **Tested end-to-end** - Pickup mutation verified working
- ✅ **Types synced** - Both apps have latest `_generated`

**📋 Integration Guide:** See `DRIVER_APP_MUTATIONS_READY.md`

npm run dev           # Terminal 2: Frontend dev server

# Database operations
npx convex run seed:seedData    # Seed initial data

## Known Constraints

1. **No Authentication** - Public access only (auth planned)
2. **No Offline Support** - Requires internet connection
3. **Single Assignment Creation** - No bulk manual entry
4. **No Export** - CSV/PDF reports not implemented

## Next Steps

### Migration to React Native Expo Router
**See `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` for complete plan**

The POC has proven the concept successfully. Next phase: Convert to mobile-first React Native Expo Router app for:
- ✅ Touch-optimized drag-and-drop for dispatcher
- ✅ Native iOS/Android apps + Web platform
- ✅ Shared Convex backend with driver mobile app
- ✅ Real-time sync and push notifications

**Migration Approach:** Create `dispatch-app/` subdirectory, preserve POC as reference

### Future POC Enhancements (if staying web-only)
- [ ] Consider adding user authentication
- [ ] Implement bulk assignment creation UI
- [ ] Add CSV export for reporting
- [ ] Add calendar month/year navigation
- [ ] Consider undo/redo for accidental deletions
